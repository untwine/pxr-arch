The library can be installed using :term:`CMake` (any version over `3.21
<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.21.html>`_).

.. _installing/dependencies:

Dependencies
============

Custom search paths to dependent packages can be provided with the following
:term:`CMake` options (or environment variable):

============================= =========================================================
Option / Environment Variable Description
============================= =========================================================
Doxygen_ROOT                  Add search path to :term:`doxygen` program.
Sphinx_ROOT                   Add search path to :term:`sphinx-build <Sphinx>` program.
============================= =========================================================

.. note::

    These feature is provided by :term:`CMake` under the `CMP0074
    <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0074.html>`_ policy

.. _installing/building:

Building library
================

Obtain a copy of the source by either downloading the
`zipball <https://github.com/untwine/pxr-arch/archive/main.zip>`_ or
cloning the public repository::

    git clone git@github.com:untwine/pxr-arch.git

Then you can build and install the library as follows::

    cd arch
    cmake -D "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/destination" -S . -B ./build ..
    cmake --build ./build --target install

Here are a few :term:`CMake` options that can be used to influence the building
process:

========================== =================================================================
Option                     Description
========================== =================================================================
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS          Indicate whether library should be built shared. Default is true.
BUILD_TESTS                Indicate whether tests should be built. Default is false.
BUILD_DOCS                 Indicate whether documentation should be built. Default is false.
CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD         Indicate the C++ standard requested. Default is C++ 17.
ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS Support pre-compiled headers. Default is false.
========================== =================================================================

The build type can be influenced by the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html>`_ option or
environment variable. By default, the "Release" build type will be used.

The library can then be used by other programs or libraries via the following
:term:`Cmake` target:

* ``pxr::arch``

.. _installing/documentation:

Building documentation
======================

Ensure that :term:`Doxygen` is installed. The required Python dependencies
must also be installed as follows::

    pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

Then build the documentation as follows::

    cmake -S . -B ./build .. -D "BUILD_DOCS=ON"
    cmake --build ./build --target documentation

.. _installing/test:

Running tests
=============

Once the library and all tests are built, you can run the tests using
:term:`Ctest` within the build folder as follows::

    ctest

You can increase the verbosity and filter in one or several tests as follows::

    ctest -VV
    ctest -R testArchDemangle -VV
